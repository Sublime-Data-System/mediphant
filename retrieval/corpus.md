Medication adherence improves outcomes in diabetes; missed doses are a leading cause of poor control.

Keep an up-to-date medication list; reconcile after every clinic or hospital visit.

Use a pill organizer or phone reminders to reduce unintentional nonadherence.

High-risk interactions include anticoagulants with NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors with potassium-sparing diuretics, and metformin around contrast imaging.

When in doubt, consult a pharmacist or clinician; online lists can be incomplete.
